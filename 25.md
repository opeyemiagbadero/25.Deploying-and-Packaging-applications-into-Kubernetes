NOTES:
Congratulations. You have just deployed JFrog Artifactory!

1. Get the Artifactory URL by running these commands:

   NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
         You can watch the status of the service by running 'kubectl get svc --namespace tools -w artifactory-artifactory-nginx'
   export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace tools artifactory-artifactory-nginx -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
   echo http://$SERVICE_IP/

2. Open Artifactory in your browser
   Default credential for Artifactory:
   user: admin
   password: password
   ```
   
 The artifactory helm chart comes bundled with the Artifactory software, a PostgreSQL database and an Nginx proxy which it uses to configure routes to the different capabilities of Artifactory. Getting the pods after some time, you should see something like the below.
 
![4 1 Runn the command kubectl get pods -n tools](https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/25.Deploying-and-Packaging-applications-into-Kubernetes/assets/79456052/9cfe6d72-0a46-48a7-995c-3e40fbdf9900)

Each of the deployed application have their respective services. This is how you will be able to reach either of them. 

![5 Each of the deployed apps have thier res  command to see thempective services   RUn kubectl get svc -n tools](https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/25.Deploying-and-Packaging-applications-into-Kubernetes/assets/79456052/86badca8-735e-43fa-b165-e6f0f9047ef2)

Notice that, the Nginx Proxy has been configured to use the service type of LoadBalancer. Therefore, to reach Artifactory, we will need to go through the Nginx proxyâ€™s service. Which happens to be a load balancer created in the cloud provider. 

Run the kubectl command to retrieve the Load Balancer URL. `kubectl get svc artifactory-artifactory-nginx -n tools`

![6  Run the kubectl get svc my-artifactory-artifactory-nginx -n tools command to get load balancer url](https://github.com/opeyemiagbadero/25.Deploying-and-Packaging-applications-into-Kubernetes/assets/79456052/820822d4-607a-4f82-ac9f-c01e5e160f3b)
